# Cypress Example

Demo of using Cypress for integration tests.

First start the app in dev mode as normal:

```
npm start
```

To open the Cypress UI:

```
npm run cy
```

Or to just run the tests with no UI:

```
npm run cy:run
```

To run the tests in a Docker container (for CI):

```
npm run test:integration
```
